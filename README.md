All files, libraries and data needed to the project are already generated : the project is ready to use.
You just need to open the file IntermediaryService.sln with Visual Studio (tested in administrator mode)
and select the version of the client that you want to run : ConsoleClient (console version) or Client (interface version).
Each client uses automatically the intermediary Web Service (IntermediaryService).
